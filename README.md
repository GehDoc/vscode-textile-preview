Full featured document live preview and rich language support, for the [Textile markup language](https://textile-lang.com/).

*Beta version !! See the [Roadmap](#roadmap).*

Based on the source code of [Visual Studio Code's Markdown Language Features](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode/tree/master/extensions/markdown-language-features), it uses [a modified version of textile.js Textile parser](https://github.com/GehDoc/textile-js) in order to display the live preview.

## Working with Textile

Create or open any file with a .textile extension, and then you can toggle the visualization of the editor between the code and the preview of the Textile file.
To switch between views, press (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+V</kbd>) in the editor. You can view the preview side-by-side (<kbd>Ctrl+K</kbd> <kbd>V</kbd>) with the file you are editing and see changes reflected in real-time as you edit.

## Features

This extension is entirely based on the Markdown preview provided by Visual Studio Code, and tries to offer the same functionalities :
* you can view Textile source and its HTML preview side by side, with synchronised scrolling;
* you can include images, from local or network, with manageable security of the preview's content;
* you can click on links, in the source view and in the HTML preview;
* the HTML preview supports VSCode light and dark themes;
* the extension is translated into the 9 VScode core languages;

### Missing features

For now, some features of the original Markdown preview have been disabled. 
To see the full list of features and interactions, you can read the documentation of the [Visual Studio Code's Markdown Language Features](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/markdown#_markdown-preview).

* Support slugify : Allow internal and external links to a paragraph header of a textile file.
